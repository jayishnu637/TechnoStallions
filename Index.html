  <h3><u>Our Motive</u></h3>
  <p>On an average, 18.7 kgs of food was disposed off by one Safal outlet daily. This suggests that an estimated 7.5 tonnes of food is discarded daily across the 400 Safal outlets in Delhi. Approximately 84.7% of the total food waste recorded was thrown in the bin, while the rest was either fed to the poor or some animals. In India, a significant amount of food is wasted during weddings and various events like parties, langar, dham etc too. However, there are NGOs in India that work tirelessly for the good of society, gathering food from such events and distributing it to those in need. As a result, we create a website that serves as a forum for individuals who held the event and NGO workers. NGO's may now simply find out where the food is still available on the website and can easily collect and distribute it.
